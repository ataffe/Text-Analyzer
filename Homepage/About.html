        <p>Hi name is Alexander Taffe. I am a computer systems engineering student Arizona State University. I made this web page based on a project from my Distributed Software Development
            my class in Spring 2017. We learned using the .NET framework but I wanted to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. So I made this website to learn and practice these skills.It is still a work in progress but I will be working on it in the weeks to come.
            The code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/ataffe/Text-Analyzer">github</a>.<br/><br/> Currently the website provides the following information:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Number of words</li>
            <li>Number of characters</li>
            <li>Longest word</li>
        </ol>
        <br/>
        <p>Coming Soon (When I get more time, from work and school)</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
            <li>Most used word</li>
            <li>Average used word</li>
            <li>Least used word</li>
            <li>Top 5 used words</li>
            <li>Standard Deviation</li>
            <li>Graphical representations of data</li>
            <li>number of vowels in each word</li>
        </ul>
